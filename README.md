# Tensorflow-in-Practice
Tensorflow in Practice : A hands-on approach on the implementation of Deep Learning Problems ranging from NLP, Computer Vision or Time-Series or Sequence related tasks. A compilation of techniques and approaches to leverage Tensorflow, Data Preparation Pipelines, Optimization Techniques, Parameter Tuning for Training, Visualization as a way to Explore Features and enrich exploration Stages and enhance feature engineering process along with a robust implementation of inspection methods to accurately measure the performance of models. 

Of special interest was to get to know how to break down time-series problems into tiny pieces, how deep learning can be transferred from one existing problem to another, how to ingest data from different sources seamlessly, along with getting introduces to special use cases where deep learning is used these days. 

Managing and distributing resources to take advantadge of parallel computing and accelerate training for those problems that may arise where the amount of data and computation demands a boost of current hardware specs are in the TO-DO list. 

NLP and Computer Vision are very much what I have always been interested in and I am looking forward to put in practice what I learnt so far in other fields like Trading where I do have a shallow understanding. So, let's get started......
